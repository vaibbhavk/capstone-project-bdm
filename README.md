## Analyzing the overall performance of Paper Tiger Stationery shop to increase profitability

## Organization Background
Paper Tiger shop was established in September 2019. It is located at Satna, Madhya Pradesh, India. They sell many items such as books, pens, pencils, engineering drawing tools, notebooks, lunch boxes, etc.

## Executive Summary
Paper Tiger stationery shop is a B2C business that deals with almost all kinds of stationery items. After meeting with the business owner, it has been told to me that they are facing tough competition with their rival. The business is being operated on low revenue to increase customer footfall and compete with their rival. Their current profit margin is 25% approx. The owner of the shop wants to gain some insights on how to maximize their profit and reduce the monthly expenses of the shop.

## Problem Statement
- To increase the profit from the shop, the business owner wants to know which items are sold less or which items are sold more, which items are more profitable, and the period in which the sales volume is high.
- To decrease the overall expenses of the shop.

## Problem Solving Approach

### Data collection methods to be used
The owner of the Paper Tiger shop keeps their entire sales record in a notebook.
They are ready to provide their 6 months of sales records as well as their monthly
shop expenses.
After getting the raw data, I will enter the records on a spreadsheet for further
analysis.

### What data to be collected?
As they are facing the problem of low profit, the data required is the sales data
and monthly shop expense data.
On the sales data, the average cost price as well as the average selling price of each
item will be given. They are ready to provide their monthly expense records.

### Tools to be used for analysis
Using the above data, I will make a revenue Pareto to analyze the monthly revenue
of the shop, and a volume Pareto to look at the month where the sales are high
volume. A bubble chart of sales to look at what items are contributing to the sales in
the majority. This would give an insight to the business owner so as to what items to
stock more or what items to stock less.

## Analysis Steps
- After entering the data, a new worksheet has been created and the sales data has been
copied into the worksheet for creating charts. The Revenue Pareto per item has been
created for each month, to analyze what items are sold most or what items are sold less on
each month.
- On another worksheet, the ‘Month’ and ‘Revenue’ columns have been created and the sales
across all the items have been summed up for each month. The Monthly Revenue Pareto
has been created, to analyze on which month the sales are less or high.
